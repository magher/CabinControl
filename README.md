# CabinControl
The goal is to be able to control the heat/lights/water/log data and what not in my mountain cabin where I got no, or limited internet access. I have been using the Tellstick Net for a while but think that is a bit limited for my purposes since it needs a stable internet connection to work properly. I need something that can switch between beeing stand alone and remote controlled.

There are out-of-the-box solutions on the market for all this..., but where's the fun in that? Also, it gives me an oppurtunity to learn how to implement Java and MQTT with Raspberry Pi and ESPXXXX devices, and that's fun :D
